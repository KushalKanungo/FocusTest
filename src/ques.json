    "Passage": "<b> </b><b>The</b><b> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</b>\r<br>\r<br>What does it take to be a good person? What makes someone a good doctor, therapist or parent? What guides policy-makers to make wise and moral decisions? Many believe that empathy \u2014 the capacity to experience the feelings of others, and particularly others\u2019 suffering \u2014 is essential to all of these roles. I argue that this is a mistake, often a tragic one.\r<br>\r<br>Empathy acts like a spotlight, focusing one's attention on a single individual in the here and now. This can have positive effects, but it can also lead to short-sighted and unfair moral actions. And it is subject to bias \u2014 both laboratory studies and anecdotal experiences show that empathy flows most for those who look like us, who are attractive and who are non-threatening and familiar. \r<br>\r<br>When we appreciate that skin color does not determine who we should care about, for example, or that a crisis such as climate change has great significance \u2014 even though it is an abstract threat \u2014 we are transcending empathy. A good policy maker makes decisions using reason, aspiring toward the sort of fairness and impartiality empathy doesn't provide. Empathy isn\u2019t just a reflex, of course. We can choose to empathize and stir empathy for others. But this flexibility can be a curse. Our empathy can be exploited by others, as when cynical politicians tell stories of victims of rape or assault and use our empathy for these victims to stoke hatred against vulnerable groups, such as undocumented immigrants. \r<br>\r<br>For those in the helping professions, compassion and understanding are critically important. But not empathy \u2014 feeling the suffering of others too acutely leads to exhaustion, burnout and ineffective work. No good therapist is awash with anxiety when working with an anxious patient. Some distance is required. The essayist Leslie Jamison has a great description of this, in writing about a good doctor who helped her: \u201cHis calmness didn\u2019t make me feel <span style=\"font-family: MS Gothic;\"></span>abandoned, it made me feel secure,\" she wrote. \"I wanted to look at him and see the opposite of my fear, not its echo.\u201d</span> <span style=\"font-family: MS Gothic;\"></span> Or consider a parent dealing with a teenager who is panicked because she left her homework to the last minute.

But compassion \u2014 caring for others without feeling their pain \u2014 does the trick quite nicely. Empathy and compassion are distinct: Recent neuroscience studies, including some fascinating work on the power of meditation, show that compassion is distinct from empathy, with all its benefits and few of its costs. Many of life\u2019s deepest pleasures, such as engagement with novels, movies and television, require empathic connection. Empathy has its place. But when it comes to being a good person, there are better alternatives.",

    "Passage": "<b> </b><b>The</b><b> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</b>\r<br>\r<br>What does it take to be a good person? What makes someone a good doctor, therapist or parent? What guides policy-makers to make wise and moral decisions? Many believe that empathy \u2014 the capacity to experience the feelings of others, and particularly others\u2019 suffering \u2014 is essential to all of these roles. I argue that this is a mistake, often a tragic one.\r<br>\r<br>Empathy acts like a spotlight, focusing one's attention on a single individual in the here and now. This can have positive effects, but it can also lead to short-sighted and unfair moral actions. And it is subject to bias \u2014 both laboratory studies and anecdotal experiences show that empathy flows most for those who look like us, who are attractive and who are non-threatening and familiar. \r<br>\r<br>When we appreciate that skin color does not determine who we should care about, for example, or that a crisis such as climate change has great significance \u2014 even though it is an abstract threat \u2014 we are transcending empathy. A good policy maker makes decisions using reason, aspiring toward the sort of fairness and impartiality empathy doesn't provide. Empathy isn\u2019t just a reflex, of course. We can choose to empathize and stir empathy for others. But this flexibility can be a curse. Our empathy can be exploited by others, as when cynical politicians tell stories of victims of rape or assault and use our empathy for these victims to stoke hatred against vulnerable groups, such as undocumented immigrants. \r<br>\r<br>For those in the helping professions, compassion and understanding are critically important. But not empathy \u2014 feeling the suffering of others too acutely leads to exhaustion, burnout and ineffective work. No good therapist is awash with anxiety when working with an anxious patient. Some distance is required. The essayist Leslie Jamison has a great description of this, in writing about a good doctor who helped her: \u201cHis calmness didn\u2019t make me feel <span style=\"font-family: MS Gothic;\"></span>abandoned, it made me feel secure,\" she wrote. \"I wanted to look at him and see the opposite of my fear, not its echo.\u201d</span> <span style=\"font-family: MS Gothic;\"></span> Or consider a parent dealing with a teenager who is panicked because she left her homework to the last minute. It\u2019s hardly good parenting to panic along with her. Good parents care for their children and understand them, but don\u2019t necessarily absorb their suffering. \r<br>\r<br>Rationality alone isn\u2019t enough to be a good person; you also need some sort of motivation. But compassion \u2014 caring for others without feeling their pain \u2014 does the trick quite nicely. Empathy and compassion are distinct: Recent neuroscience studies, including some fascinating work on the power of meditation, show that compassion is distinct from empathy, with all its benefits and few of its costs. Many of life\u2019s deepest pleasures, such as engagement with novels, movies and television, require empathic connection. Empathy has its place. But when it comes to being a good person, there are better alternatives.",

    "Explanation": "<p>Option 1 is empathy itself hence not the transcending of it. Option 2 is incorrect, because we do not transcend by giving up our identity with the other\u2013 e.g., a white man need not give up his identity and identify himself with blacks. Even this may be the conventional definition of empathy and not transcending it. In other words, \u2018trying to be in another person\u2019s shoes\u2019 is not transcending empathy. Option 3 is the convenient form of empathy - for people who are like us. Option 4 is correct. The passage states: \u201cWhen we appreciate that<span>skin\u00a0</span><span>color</span><span> does not determine who we should care about</span><span>, for example, or that a crisis such as climate change has great significance \u2014 even though it is an abstract threat \u2014\u00a0</span><span>we are transcending empathy</span><span>.\u201d In effect, we choose to care about people without the distinction of ethnicity or ideology, we transcend empathy. Hence option 4 expresses the same idea.\u00a0</span><span>Hence, [4].</span></p>",

A recent study, published in Science, suggests there isn\u2019t. The study measured the survival probabilities of 3,896 people in Italy aged 105 and older. It found that, while we are much more likely to die at 75 than at 55, once we reach about 105, the odds of death remain about the same each year of life.<br><br>This effect is often referred to as a \u201cmortality plateau\u201d. If it were impossible to live past a certain age, we would expect mortality rates to continue rising as people age, rather than plateau. The fact that the odds of dying don\u2019t appear to increase past 105 suggests that we have not yet approached our maximum lifespan as a species. But is potentially living for over a century something we ought to look forward to? Here, philosophy can offer some important insights.<br><br>Of course, we still don\u2019t know for sure that there is no ceiling. Some researchers argue that there is a natural \u201cexpiration date\u201d for human beings, at about 125 years. Chiyo Miyako is currently the oldest known person in the world, at 117 years old. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997, had the longest recorded lifespan, at 122 years.<br>In the UK, the number of people over the age of 100 has more than doubled since 2002, and could reach 36,000 by 2030. If there is a mortality plateau, by the year 2300 the oldest person alive could be about 150 years old.<br><br>Would a maximum lifespan of 150 make our lives better or just longer? One way of thinking about this is in terms of pleasure and pain: the more pleasure (and the less pain) we have over the course of our lives, the better our lives are. Other things being equal, a life which lasts 100 years is better than one that lasts 80 years, as long as the extra 20 years contain more pleasure than they do pain.<br><br>How likely an outcome is this?

Experiential interests are for things like pleasure \u2013 anything we enjoy. Critical interests are those that we value becoming a reality \u2013 essential to what we think constitutes a good life.

Choose the best answer for each question.</b><br><br> <b><u>  </u></b><br>One of the biggest questions in ageing research is whether there is a ceiling on how long human beings can live. A recent study, published in Science, suggests there isn\u2019t. The study measured the survival probabilities of 3,896 people in Italy aged 105 and older. It found that, while we are much more likely to die at 75 than at 55, once we reach about 105, the odds of death remain about the same each year of life.<br><br>This effect is often referred to as a \u201cmortality plateau\u201d. If it were impossible to live past a certain age, we would expect mortality rates to continue rising as people age, rather than plateau. The fact that the odds of dying don\u2019t appear to increase past 105 suggests that we have not yet approached our maximum lifespan as a species. But is potentially living for over a century something we ought to look forward to? Here, philosophy can offer some important insights.<br><br>Of course, we still don\u2019t know for sure that there is no ceiling. Some researchers argue that there is a natural \u201cexpiration date\u201d for human beings, at about 125 years. Chiyo Miyako is currently the oldest known person in the world, at 117 years old. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997, had the longest recorded lifespan, at 122 years.<br>In the UK, the number of people over the age of 100 has more than doubled since 2002, and could reach 36,000 by 2030. If there is a mortality plateau, by the year 2300 the oldest person alive could be about 150 years old.<br><br>Would a maximum lifespan of 150 make our lives better or just longer? One way of thinking about this is in terms of pleasure and pain: the more pleasure (and the less pain) we have over the course of our lives, the better our lives are. Other things being equal, a life which lasts 100 years is better than one that lasts 80 years, as long as the extra 20 years contain more pleasure than they do pain.<br><br>How likely an outcome is this? As people age, they are much more likely to develop degenerative conditions that could lead to a lower quality of life. But these conditions can be mitigated by a healthy lifestyle and adequate support services. While elderly life may be restricted in some ways, there is no reason that it cannot be, on balance, pleasurable.<br><br>The late philosopher Ronald Dworkin distinguished between \u201cexperiential interests\u201d and \u201ccritical interests\u201d to shed light on how people may view their life goals. Experiential interests are for things like pleasure \u2013 anything we enjoy. Critical interests are those that we value becoming a reality \u2013 essential to what we think constitutes a good life. This could be a parent\u2019s interest in the happiness of their child, for example.<br><br>We can imagine a person having a critical interest in avoiding the perceived indignity of dementia, which may accompany extreme old age. We might think it would be better for this person, taking the whole of their life into account, if they had died prior to this period of decline.",

Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Faced with unfavourable, often seasonal, changes in climate or habitat quality, animals, from birds to butterflies and wildebeests to sea turtles, migrate vast distances\u2014often thousands of miles\u2014in search of more favourable conditions. They return the following year, in many cases to the exact location where their journey began. \u2026 We know that some species use the Earth\u2019s magnetic field to navigate with GPS-like precision and others gaze skyward and guide their migration by the stars. We are just now learning that for some animals, the key to a successful migration is all in their heads\u2014complex thought and memory are also necessary for a successful migration.

When these turtles take to land each summer, migrating to new habitats when their home ponds dry up, they face seemingly insurmountable odds: scorching heat, dehydration, the crushing tug of gravity, new predatory threats from both land and air, and the ever-present threat of vehicles when crossing a road. <br /><br />Painted turtles at our research site, which is on conservation land within a patchwork of old growth woodlands and agricultural fields, follow long, intricate routes with amazing precision\u2014specific to within a few meters\u2014to far-off, permanent water sources year after year, returning home again when the seasons next change. \u2026 To see just where this incredible migratory behaviour came from, we introduced into our site animals without any experience migrating there and monitored their ability to respond to seasonal changes in their habitats. Naive juveniles under four years old learned to navigate the complex paths just as precisely as experienced local turtles and were able to locate far-off water sources. Naive adults could not. <br /><br />How can a turtle possibly think its way through migration? They do it the same way that we do: they form and remember memories of space and place using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has long been known to play a role in spatial memory in mammals. To test whether the turtle brain also works this way, we gave freely migrating turtles (both experienced adults and naive juveniles) mind-altering drugs that temporarily block acetylcholine in their brains.<br /><br />While the drugs were active and the turtles were without access to spatial memory, the adults with previous experience in the system wandered aimlessly and were unable to follow their traditional migration routes. As soon as the drugs wore off, they got right back on track and were able to successfully migrate to their winter home. And what about naive juvenile turtles? They were unaffected by the drug; they followed the paths perfectly whether on the drug or not. Why? They had no memory to disrupt! This demonstrates that adults use spatial memory to navigate during migration, and that they form these memories as juveniles prior to the age of four. This type of higher-order cognitive processing during migration has been previously attributed only to birds and mammals.</p>",

They return the following year, in many cases to the exact location where their journey began. \u2026 We know that some species use the Earth\u2019s magnetic field to navigate with GPS-like precision and others gaze skyward and guide their migration by the stars. We are just now learning that for some animals, the key to a successful migration is all in their heads\u2014complex thought and memory are also necessary for a successful migration. For nearly a decade, we have studied the roles of cognition, learning and memory in the migration of a fairly atypical species\u2014the painted turtle, common to neighbourhood ponds and roadside ditches.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re not as charismatic as sea turtles, and they sure don\u2019t travel as far \u2026 but what they lack in outward charisma they make up in tenacity. When these turtles take to land each summer, migrating to new habitats when their home ponds dry up, they face seemingly insurmountable odds: scorching heat, dehydration, the crushing tug of gravity, new predatory threats from both land and air, and the ever-present threat of vehicles when crossing a road. <br /><br />Painted turtles at our research site, which is on conservation land within a patchwork of old growth woodlands and agricultural fields, follow long, intricate routes with amazing precision\u2014specific to within a few meters\u2014to far-off, permanent water sources year after year, returning home again when the seasons next change. \u2026 To see just where this incredible migratory behaviour came from, we introduced into our site animals without any experience migrating there and monitored their ability to respond to seasonal changes in their habitats. Naive juveniles under four years old learned to navigate the complex paths just as precisely as experienced local turtles and were able to locate far-off water sources. Naive adults could not. <br /><br />How can a turtle possibly think its way through migration? They do it the same way that we do: they form and remember memories of space and place using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has long been known to play a role in spatial memory in mammals. To test whether the turtle brain also works this way, we gave freely migrating turtles (both experienced adults and naive juveniles) mind-altering drugs that temporarily block acetylcholine in their brains.<br /><br />While the drugs were active and the turtles were without access to spatial memory, the adults with previous experience in the system wandered aimlessly and were unable to follow their traditional migration routes. As soon as the drugs wore off, they got right back on track and were able to successfully migrate to their winter home. And what about naive juvenile turtles? They were unaffected by the drug; they followed the paths perfectly whether on the drug or not. Why? They had no memory to disrupt! This demonstrates that adults use spatial memory to navigate during migration, and that they form these memories as juveniles prior to the age of four. This type of higher-order cognitive processing during migration has been previously attributed only to birds and mammals.</p>",

Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Antarctic glaciers have been melting at an accelerating pace over the past four decades thanks to an influx of warm ocean water \u2014 a startling new finding that researchers say could mean sea levels are poised to rise more quickly than predicted in coming decades.</span><br /><br />The Antarctic lost 40 billion tons of melting ice to the ocean each year from 1979 to 1989.</span> That figure rose to 252 billion tons lost per year beginning in 2009, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That means the region is losing six times as much ice as it was four decades ago, an unprecedented pace in the era of modern measurements. </span><br /><br />\u201cI don\u2019t want to be alarmist,\u201d said Eric </span>Rignot</span>, an Earth-systems scientist for the University of California at Irvine and NASA who led the work. But he said the weaknesses that researchers have detected in East Antarctica \u2014 home to the largest ice sheet on the planet \u2014 deserve deeper study.</span><br /><br />The places undergoing changes in Antarctica are not limited to just a couple places,\u201d </span>Rignot</span> said. \u201cThey seem to be more extensive than what we thought. That, to me, seems to be reason for concern.\u201d</span><br /><br />The findings are the latest sign that the world could face catastrophic consequences if climate change continues unabated. In addition to more-frequent droughts, heat waves, severe storms and other extreme weather that could come with a continually warming Earth, scientists already have predicted that seas could rise nearly three feet globally by 2100 if the world does not sharply decrease its carbon output. But in recent years, there has been growing concern that the Antarctic could push that even higher.</span><br /><br />That kind of sea-level rise would result in the inundation of island communities around the globe, devastating wildlife habitats and threatening drinking-water supplies.

In addition to more-frequent droughts, heat waves, severe storms and other extreme weather that could come with a continually warming Earth, scientists already have predicted that seas could rise nearly three feet globally by 2100 if the world does not sharply decrease its carbon output.

    "Explanation": "<p>Answer Option 3 is not in agreement with the facts outlined in the passage. Option 1 is presented as factual data presented in sentence 1 and 2 of paragraph 2.<span>(The Antarctic lost 40 billion tons of melting ice to the ocean each year from 1979 to 1989.</span><span> That figure rose to 252 billion tons lost\u00a0</span>per year \u2026 the region is losing six times as much ice as it was four decades ago, an unprecedented pace in the era of modern measurements.). Option 2 is supported by paragraph 7, \u201cThe outward ice flow is normal and natural, and it is typically offset by some 2 trillion tons of snowfall atop Antarctica each year, a process that on its own would leave Earth\u2019s sea level relatively unchanged. \u201c Option 4 can be inferred from the last paragraph, \u201cWest Antarctica is the continent\u2019s major ice loser \u2026\u00a0<span>Thwaites</span><span> Glacier, the biggest and potentially most vulnerable in the region, has lost 634 billion\u201d implies that the loss is the highest there. The writer does not attribute the rise in sea levels to human activities directly. It is said that emissions (carbon output) are responsible for the phenomenon. Though he states that \u201cif the world does not sharply decrease its carbon output\u201d sea levels can further increase, he does not attribute the phenomenon itself to human activities. The implication is that it may be accelerated by human activities.\u00a0</span><span>Hence, [3].</span></p>",

Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Antarctic glaciers have been melting at an accelerating pace over the past four decades thanks to an influx of warm ocean water \u2014 a startling new finding that researchers say could mean sea levels are poised to rise more quickly than predicted in coming decades.</span><br /><br />The Antarctic lost 40 billion tons of melting ice to the ocean each year from 1979 to 1989.</span> That figure rose to 252 billion tons lost per year beginning in 2009, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That means the region is losing six times as much ice as it was four decades ago, an unprecedented pace in the era of modern measurements. </span><br /><br />\u201cI don\u2019t want to be alarmist,\u201d said Eric </span>Rignot</span>, an Earth-systems scientist for the University of California at Irvine and NASA who led the work. But he said the weaknesses that researchers have detected in East Antarctica \u2014 home to the largest ice sheet on the planet \u2014 deserve deeper study.</span><br /><br />The places undergoing changes in Antarctica are not limited to just a couple places,\u201d </span>Rignot</span> said. \u201cThey seem to be more extensive than what we thought. That, to me, seems to be reason for concern.\u201d</span><br /><br />The findings are the latest sign that the world could face catastrophic consequences if climate change continues unabated. In addition to more-frequent droughts, heat waves, severe storms and other extreme weather that could come with a continually warming Earth, scientists already have predicted that seas could rise nearly three feet globally by 2100 if the world does not sharply decrease its carbon output. But in recent years, there has been growing concern that the Antarctic could push that even higher.</span><br /><br />That kind of sea-level rise would result in the inundation of island communities around the globe, devastating wildlife habitats and threatening drinking-water supplies. Global sea levels have already risen seven to eight inches since 1900</span>.</span><br /><br />The ice of Antarctica contains 57.2 meters, or 187.66 feet, of potential sea-level rise. This massive body of ice flows out into the ocean through a complex array of partially submerged glaciers and thick floating expanses of ice called ice shelves.</span><br /><br />The outward ice flow is normal and natural, and it is typically offset by some 2 trillion tons of snowfall atop Antarctica each year, a process that on its own would leave Earth\u2019s sea level relatively unchanged. However, if the ice flow speeds up, the ice sheet\u2019s losses can outpace snowfall volume. When that happens, seas rise.</span><br /><br />That\u2019s what the new research says is happening. Scientists came to that conclusion after systematically computing gains and losses across 65 sectors of Antarctica where large glaciers \u2014 or glaciers flowing into an ice shelf \u2014 reach the sea.</span><br /><br />West Antarctica is the continent\u2019s major ice loser. The</span> research affirms that finding, detailing how a single glacier, Pine Island, has lost more than a trillion tons of ice since 1979. </span>Thwaites</span> Glacier, the biggest and potentially most vulnerable in the region, has lost 634 billion. The entire West Antarctic ice sheet is capable of driving a sea-level rise of 5.28 meters, or 17.32 feet, and is now losing 159 billion tons every year.</span></p>",

Distributive justice is another form of egalitarianism that addresses life outcomes and the allocation of valuable things such as income, wealth, and other goods. Is egalitarianism about subjective feelings of well-being, about wealth and income, about a broader conception of resources, or some other alternative?
