    "Explanation": "The argument the author presents is that traits which   currently seem counterintuitive or redundant in living creatures, actually have a basis in evolution - examples in the passage include the attention seeking feathers of birds that attract mates, the human chin that has carried over from larger muscles and jaws for intensive chewing, etc. These examples help the author make arguments that \u201c\u2026strengthen(s) the theory of evolution in that these seemingly weaker individuals are actually showing how well they can do in the face of adversity.\u201d (Paragraph 2 - sentence 5) The author makes the same argument about vestigial too, proving that evolution has a role to play in traits that appear quirky or useless, if one studies them closely. This is also why option 2 is not the correct choice. Besides option 2 is the other end of the extreme, dismissing the role of evolution in any biological trait or characteristic altogether and is therefore not compatible with the views of the author in the passage. Option 3, is not the central argument, and is not true based on the information of the passage - in paragraph 2, the author describes how sexual selection is the reason some birds have ostentatious plumage. There is no mention of the role of sexual selection being larger than it is deemed to be. Option 4 is not correct  because not only is it not the central premise of the passage but it is also incoherent with the information in the passage- \u201cAs human diets changed, the bones and muscles in our jaws became smaller so we didn\u2019t waste energy on them but we were left with a protruding bone at the bottom of the face\u2026Although the chin throws a spandrel in the works, there is nearly always a reason or, at least, an explanation for the myriad traits we see across biology.\u201d The author means therefore, that the chin is not a quirk that exists for its own sake but can actually be traced back to its evolutionary purpose.&nbsp;<span>Hence, [1]</span><span>.</span>",

    "Passage": "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />The problem of time is one of the greatest puzzles of modern physics. The first bit of the conundrum is cosmological. To understand time, scientists talk about finding a \u2018First Cause\u2019 or \u2018initial condition\u2019 \u2013 a description of the Universe at the very beginning (or at \u2018time equals zero\u2019). But to determine a system\u2019s initial condition, we need to know the total system. We need to make measurements of the positions and velocities of its constituent parts, such as particles, atoms, fields and so forth. This problem hits a hard wall when we deal with the origin of the Universe itself, because we have no view from the outside. We can\u2019t step outside the box in order to look within, because the box is all there is. A First Cause is not only unknowable, but also scientifically unintelligible.<br /><br />The second part of the challenge is philosophical. Scientists have taken physical time to be the only real time \u2013 whereas experiential time, the subjective sense of time\u2019s passing, is considered a cognitive fabrication of secondary importance. The young Albert Einstein made this position clear in his debate with philosopher Henri Bergson in the 1920s, when he claimed that the physicist\u2019s time is the only time. With age, Einstein became more circumspect. Up to the time of his death, he remained deeply troubled about how to find a place for the human experience of time in the scientific worldview.<br /><br />These quandaries rest on the presumption that physical time, with an absolute starting point, is the only real kind of time. But what if the question of the beginning of time is ill-posed? Many of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed. In our urge for knowledge and control, we\u2019ve created a vision of science as a series of discoveries about how reality is in itself, a God\u2019s-eye view of nature.<br /><br />Such an approach not only distorts the truth, but creates a false sense of distance between ourselves and the world. That divide arises from what we call the Blind Spot, which science itself cannot see. In the Blind Spot site experience:the sheer presence and immediacy of lived perception.<br /><br />Behind the Blind Spot sits the belief that physical reality has absolute primacy in human knowledge, a view that can be called scientific materialism. In philosophical terms, it combines scientific objectivism(science tells us about the real, mind-independent world) and physicalism(science tells us that physical reality is all there is). Elementary particles, moments in time, genes, the brain \u2013 all these things are assumed to be fundamentally real. By contrast, experience, awareness and consciousness are taken to be secondary. The scientific task becomes about figuring out how to reduce them to something physical, such as the behaviour of neural networks,the architecture of computational systems, or some measure of information.</p>",

    "Explanation": "The central argument of this passage is that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;\u2018Blind Spot\u2019 (or a gap) between the scientific explanations of physical reality, and the subjectivity of perceived human experience which is overlooked by science , often leading to a distorted understanding of reality. Option 2 mentions  that scientific materialism, which is explained by the author as a combination of scientific objectivity and a dependence on physical reality, leads to a distorted understanding of truth by not focusing enough on that which is experiential (experienced). Option 1 is not correct because it talks about the two obstructions to a scientific understanding of the notion of time. While the author talks about time, and the misperception of it due to different variables, that is an example used to build the central argument about science, and not the central argument itself. Option 3, too is not the&nbsp;correct choice because it focuses on the problem of time which is not the central argument but, merely a reference used by the author to build the central argument. Option 4 can be eliminated because it is in complete contrast to what the author is trying to say. In paragraph 5, the author writes&nbsp;\u201cElementary particles, moments in time, genes, the brain&nbsp;</span>\u2013&nbsp;all these things are assumed to be fundamentally real. By contrast, experience, awareness and consciousness are taken to be secondary. The scientific task becomes about figuring out how to reduce them to something physical, such as the behaviour of</span>neural networks,</span>the architecture of computational systems, or some measure of information.\u201d Here the author says that to translate experience, awareness and consciousness into something like systems, behaviors and information is to reduce them.

    "Passage": "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />The problem of time is one of the greatest puzzles of modern physics. The first bit of the conundrum is cosmological. To understand time, scientists talk about finding a \u2018First Cause\u2019 or \u2018initial condition\u2019 \u2013 a description of the Universe at the very beginning (or at \u2018time equals zero\u2019). But to determine a system\u2019s initial condition, we need to know the total system. We need to make measurements of the positions and velocities of its constituent parts, such as particles, atoms, fields and so forth. This problem hits a hard wall when we deal with the origin of the Universe itself, because we have no view from the outside. We can\u2019t step outside the box in order to look within, because the box is all there is. A First Cause is not only unknowable, but also scientifically unintelligible.<br /><br />The second part of the challenge is philosophical. Scientists have taken physical time to be the only real time \u2013 whereas experiential time, the subjective sense of time\u2019s passing, is considered a cognitive fabrication of secondary importance. The young Albert Einstein made this position clear in his debate with philosopher Henri Bergson in the 1920s, when he claimed that the physicist\u2019s time is the only time. With age, Einstein became more circumspect. Up to the time of his death, he remained deeply troubled about how to find a place for the human experience of time in the scientific worldview.<br /><br />These quandaries rest on the presumption that physical time, with an absolute starting point, is the only real kind of time. But what if the question of the beginning of time is ill-posed? Many of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed. In our urge for knowledge and control, we\u2019ve created a vision of science as a series of discoveries about how reality is in itself, a God\u2019s-eye view of nature.<br /><br />Such an approach not only distorts the truth, but creates a false sense of distance between ourselves and the world. That divide arises from what we call the Blind Spot, which science itself cannot see. In the Blind Spot site experience:the sheer presence and immediacy of lived perception.<br /><br />Behind the Blind Spot sits the belief that physical reality has absolute primacy in human knowledge, a view that can be called scientific materialism. In philosophical terms, it combines scientific objectivism(science tells us about the real, mind-independent world) and physicalism(science tells us that physical reality is all there is). Elementary particles, moments in time, genes, the brain \u2013 all these things are assumed to be fundamentally real. By contrast, experience, awareness and consciousness are taken to be secondary. The scientific task becomes about figuring out how to reduce them to something physical, such as the behaviour of neural networks,the architecture of computational systems, or some measure of information.</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Option 1 is not in agreement with the passage because the passage describes that Einstein who subscribed to the scientists view that \u2018physicist\u2019s time is the only time\u2019 did not uphold the view in his later years. He became interested in experiential or relative time, \u201cUp to the time of his death, he remained deeply troubled about how to find a place for the human experience of time in the scientific worldview.\u201d Option 2<strong></strong>is in agreement with the passage. This is clear in the very opening of the passage, Paragraph 1, sentence 3: \u201cTo understand time, scientists talk about finding a\u00a0\u2018First Cause\u2019 or \u2018initial condition\u2019 \u2013\u00a0a description of the Universe at the very beginning (or at\u00a0\u2018time equals zero\u2019).\u201d Option 3 is also based on the argument the author presents in paragraph 3, stating that the objectivity of science often leaves out subjective perception. \u201cMany of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed. In our urge for knowledge and control, we\u2019ve created a vision of science as a series of discoveries about how reality is in itself, a God\u2019s-eye view of nature.\u201d The loophole in Option 3 is the \u201cBlind Spot\u201d that the author talks of through the rest of this passage. Option 4 is a rephrasing of\u00a0the first sentence of paragraph 5, \u201cBehind the Blind Spot sits the belief that physical reality has absolute primacy in human knowledge, a view that can be calledscientific materialism.\u201d Hence, [1].</p>",

In the Blind Spot site experience:the sheer presence and immediacy of lived perception.<br /><br />Behind the Blind Spot sits the belief that physical reality has absolute primacy in human knowledge, a view that can be called scientific materialism. In philosophical terms, it combines scientific objectivism(science tells us about the real, mind-independent world) and physicalism(science tells us that physical reality is all there is). Elementary particles, moments in time, genes, the brain \u2013 all these things are assumed to be fundamentally real. By contrast, experience, awareness and consciousness are taken to be secondary. The scientific task becomes about figuring out how to reduce them to something physical, such as the behaviour of neural networks,the architecture of computational systems, or some measure of information.</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Throughout the passage the author talks about a God\u2019s eye view - or an objective, external view of things that science takes, in contrast to an ant-eye view of human consciousness, or subjective experience which option 3 describes as \u2018fixed totality of mind independent objects\u201d. Option 1 can be eliminated because the passage does not speak oftheology or\u00a0religion; Option 2 is incorrect because it is referring to a subjective viewpoint, which is in conflict with the sentences in paragraph 3 that priced this sentence \u201cMany of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed.\u201d The clue that helps eliminate Option 4, is the phrase \u2018emotionally detached\u2019 which is not apparent anywhere in the arguments presented in the passage. Hence, [3].</p>",

    "Passage": "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Like a brain, an ant colony operates without central control. Each is a set of interacting individuals, either neurons or ants, using simple chemical interactions that in the aggregate generate their behaviour. People use their brains to remember. Can ant colonies do that? This question leads to another question: what is memory? For people, memory is the capacity to recall something that happened in the past. We also ask computers to reproduce past actions \u2013 the blending of the idea of the computer as brain and brain as computer has led us to take \u2018memory\u2019 to mean something like the information stored on a hard drive. We know that our memory relies on changes in how much a set of linked neurons stimulate each other; that it is reinforced somehow during sleep; and that recent and long-term memory involve different circuits of connected neurons. But there is much we still don\u2019t know about how those neural events come together, whether there are stored representations that we use to talk about something that happened in the past, or how we can keep performing a previously learned task such as reading or riding a bicycle.<br /><br />Any living being can exhibit the simplest form of memory, a change due to past events. Look at a tree that has lost a branch. It remembers by how it grows around the wound, leaving traces in the pattern of the bark and the shape of the tree. You might be able to describe the last time you had the flu, or you might not. Either way, in some sense your body \u2018remembers\u2019, because some of your cells now have different antibodies, molecular receptors, which fit that particular virus.<br /><br />Past events can alter the behaviour of both individual ants and ant colonies. Individual carpenter ants offered a sugar treat remembered its location for a few minutes; they were likely to return to where the food had been. Another species, the Sahara Desert ant, meanders around the barren desert, searching for food. It appears that an ant of this species can remember how far it walked, or how many steps it took, since the last time it was at the nest.<br /><br />A redwood ant colony remembers its trail system leading to the same trees, year after year, although no single ant does. In the forests of Europe, they forage in high trees to feed on the excretions of aphids that in turn feed on the tree. Their nests are enormous mounds of pine needles situated in the same place for decades, occupied by many generations of colonies. Each ant tends to take the same trail day after day to the same tree. During the long winter, the ants huddle together under the snow. The Finnish myrmecologist Rainer Rosengren showed that when the ants emerge in the spring, an older ant goes out with a young one along the older ant\u2019s habitual trail. The older ant dies and the younger ant adopts that trail as its own, thus leading the colony to remember, or reproduce, the previous year\u2019s trails.</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>The passage predominantly describes the role of memory in ant colonies and individual ants, citing examples of redwood ant colonies, Sahara Desert ants and carpenter ants. The author constructs this argument by building a larger argument around what memory is, and how it shapesbehaviour in trees, humans and ants. Option 1 is an incorrect option because although the passage makes reference to the retention and retrieval of memory among ant colonies and individual ants, it doesn\u2019t make any reference to codes and means of functioning. Option 3 can be eliminated because the passage does not compare the red wood ants with the Sahara Desert Ant - In Paragraph 3 the author describes the memory of the Sahara desert ant, and in paragraph 4, he describes the red wood ant, without any comparison between the two. Option 4 is incorrect because the only reference the passage makes to the memories of ants is at the opening of the passage, \u201cLike a brain, an ant colony operates without central control. Each is a set of interacting individuals, either neurons or ants, using simple chemical\u00a0interactions that in the aggregate generate their behaviour.\u201d There is no evidence in the passage of linked traces stored in the neurons.

We also ask computers to reproduce past actions \u2013 the blending of the idea of the computer as brain and brain as computer has led us to take \u2018memory\u2019 to mean something like the information stored on a hard drive. We know that our memory relies on changes in how much a set of linked neurons stimulate each other; that it is reinforced somehow during sleep; and that recent and long-term memory involve different circuits of connected neurons. But there is much we still don\u2019t know about how those neural events come together, whether there are stored representations that we use to talk about something that happened in the past, or how we can keep performing a previously learned task such as reading or riding a bicycle.<br /><br />Any living being can exhibit the simplest form of memory, a change due to past events. Look at a tree that has lost a branch. It remembers by how it grows around the wound, leaving traces in the pattern of the bark and the shape of the tree. You might be able to describe the last time you had the flu, or you might not. Either way, in some sense your body \u2018remembers\u2019, because some of your cells now have different antibodies, molecular receptors, which fit that particular virus.<br /><br />Past events can alter the behaviour of both individual ants and ant colonies. Individual carpenter ants offered a sugar treat remembered its location for a few minutes; they were likely to return to where the food had been. Another species, the Sahara Desert ant, meanders around the barren desert, searching for food. It appears that an ant of this species can remember how far it walked, or how many steps it took, since the last time it was at the nest.<br /><br />A redwood ant colony remembers its trail system leading to the same trees, year after year, although no single ant does. In the forests of Europe, they forage in high trees to feed on the excretions of aphids that in turn feed on the tree. Their nests are enormous mounds of pine needles situated in the same place for decades, occupied by many generations of colonies. Each ant tends to take the same trail day after day to the same tree. During the long winter, the ants huddle together under the snow. The Finnish myrmecologist Rainer Rosengren showed that when the ants emerge in the spring, an older ant goes out with a young one along the older ant\u2019s habitual trail. The older ant dies and the younger ant adopts that trail as its own, thus leading the colony to remember, or reproduce, the previous year\u2019s trails.</p>",

    "Explanation": "It is best to understand why the author has used this sentence by studying the context - This sentence appears in paragraph 2 of the passa</span>ge, where the author is explaining</span> what memory is in its simplest form.&nbsp;</span>First, t</span>he paragraph cites the examples of trees and then the example of the human body, in supporting the argument that, \u201cAny living being can exhibit the simplest form of memory, a change due to past events.\u201d (paragraph 2, sentence 1). Option 2 and 3 are not correct options because the author is neither contradicting his argument, nor is he refuting what memory is conventionally described as. If anything, he is confirming that this is an example of the simplest form of memory. Option 4 is not the correct choice , because the author explains how memory involves the brain and neurons, in paragraph 1 - \u201c \u2026and brain as computer has led us to take \u2018memory\u2019 to mean something like the information stored on a hard drive. We know that our memory relies on changes in how much a set of linked neurons stimulate each other; that it is reinforced somehow during sleep; and that recent and long-term memory involve different circuits of connected neurons.\u201d He then goes on to describe how these changes lead to changes in&nbsp;</span>behaviour</span>, and does not distinguish between memory in the body v/s memory in the brain.

To be able to come up with a dead-baby joke, one needs not only a punch line, but a macabre one. To be able to laugh at such a joke, one needs to have a strong stomach and keep moralistic thinking at bay. The now infamous comedian Louis CK uses black comedy in his acts as well as his namesake television show. His work was disturbing yet hilarious \u2013 until he went too far, joking about high-school students massacred with guns.

    "Explanation": "<p><span>The phrase \u201cslippery slope\u201d means \u2018an idea or course of action which will lead to something unacceptable, wrong, or disastrous\u2019. The author uses this in relation to the end goal of creativity differentiating between using creativity for planning a birthday party v/s using it to perform a surprise threat. Sentences 3 & 4 of paragraph 4 help in understanding this: \u201cCan we then channel our dark energies to bring joy to others? Sure; but this can become a slippery slope. If the goal switches to planning a surprise theft, the same skills can harm others.\u201d What this means is that if one slips into the trap of negatively harnessing creativity, it can cause damage. Option 2 is incorrect, because the sentence does not make any claim about a reduction in creativity. Option 3 is also incorrect, because neither preceding nor following sentences speak about a person\u2019s intelligence. Option 4 is an incorrect option because the author does not make a correlation between the da</span><span>rk side of creativity and time.</span> <br /><span>Hence, [1].</span></p>",

    "Explanation": "<p><span>While the passage makes a reference to an indecisive customer, it does so in the context of advertisers cashing in on a customer\u2019s indecisiveness i.e. using it to their advantage - paragraph 5, sentence 3, \u201cSure; it\u2019s an underhand way to get through to your undecided consumer.\u201d It does not say anything about ridiculing it.

Just consider some innovative advertising campaigns deriding a competitor\u2019s product in favour of one\u2019s own\u2026\u201d Option 2 is also true.

    "Passage": "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of </strong><strong>4</strong><strong> questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Laypersons and academics alike have largely viewed creativity as a positive force, a notion challenged by the philosopher and educator Robert McLaren of California State University, Fullerton in 1993. <span style=\"color: #000000;\">McLaren proposed\u00a0</span>that creativity had a dark side. As time went on, newer concepts \u2013<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;\">negative</span>\u00a0and\u00a0malevolent<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u00a0</span>creativity \u2013 included conceiving original ways to cheat on tests or doing purposeful harm to others, for instance, innovating new ways to execute terrorist attacks.</p><p><br />We looked at the problem through what psychologists call the four Ps of creativity \u2013 person (the individual engaging in the act), process (the strategy employed), product (the creative outcome itself), and press (the situation at hand.) After a series of five experiments, we concluded that negative creativity (product) is most likely to be displayed by highly intelligent persons, with subclinical negative personality traits such as psychopathy, especially in open-ended situations where deception can succeed. When creative people had a negative, morally questionable goal up-front, they were also more likely to lie.<br /><br />We confirmed the contention that the dark side of creativity exists, and is one that it\u2019s important to acknowledge and understand. People can get hurt in surprising and original ways by practitioners of this dark craft. And, just as important, an entire set of misbehaviours with the potential to help us learn more about human creativity may be going unnoticed and ignored.<br /><br />What if, after knowing that the dark side exists, we consciously try to use it? Is that really always bad? Perhaps we won\u2019t lie to get into a theatre \u2013 but what if a surprise birthday party for a friend requires sly and crafty planning, coordination, and a great deal of deception and misdirection? Can we then channel our dark energies to bring joy to others? Sure; but this can become a slippery slope. If the goal switches to planning a surprise theft, the same skills can harm others.<br /><br />The dark art has been here all along. Just consider some innovative advertising campaigns deriding a competitor\u2019s product in favour of one\u2019s own: the cola wars, the burger wars and the coffee wars are all notorious for hinting at the competition\u2019s lower quality, with direct or indirect references. Is this dark? Sure; it\u2019s an underhand way to get through to your undecided consumer. Is it creative? Of course! Should it be used? Definitely \u2013 it\u2019s meant to increase your profit in a competitive world.<br /><br />Dark humour should take a bow, as well. To be able to come up with a dead-baby joke, one needs not only a punch line, but a macabre one. To be able to laugh at such a joke, one needs to have a strong stomach and keep moralistic thinking at bay. The now infamous comedian Louis CK uses black comedy in his acts as well as his namesake television show. His work was disturbing yet hilarious \u2013 until he went too far, joking about high-school students massacred with guns. One can argue that dark humour has the potential to psychologically harm others \u2013 but dark jokes made with intent to elicit laughter highlight the importance of distinguishing means and ends in creative pursuits.</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>The first paragraph states laymen and academics view creativity as positive. McLaren, however, proposed a dark side to it \u2013 when it is viewed without a moral lens. This leads to our limited understanding of creativity. The problem lay in creativity being understood without the social and moral lens. Hence option 1 is the problem. Option 2 is an example, and option 3 is an aspect of creativity. Option 4 in itself is not the problem \u2013 the problem is limited understanding of creativity. Hence,<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>",

But the info is limited. Satellite data often tells you what happens after it's happened. Sound recordings can supplement satellite data, as another conservation tool. So you can hear things like chainsaws or gunshots in real time. So you can get out ahead of potential deforestation before it occurs. Small audio recorders, some of which are solar-powered and hooked to cell phone grids for data upload, also give ecologists the ability to eavesdrop on a jungle's biodiversity over time. If you're in a primary forest, you'll tend to see all the frequencies of the soundscape occupied by different species. As you move into a more disturbed ecosystem, you'd start to see more gaps across the frequencies of that soundscape. Certain insects dominate. And the diversity of calls declines as disturbance increases.",

    "Explanation": "<p>Answer: Option <strong>4213.</strong> The phrase, \u2018this island\u2019 in sentence 2 connects to \u2018a small island in the vast ocean of ignorance\u2019 in sentence 4 \u2013 hence 42 is a mandatory pair. \u2018\u2026the activity of gaining knowledge\u2019 in sentence 1 is an explanation of \u2018the scientific enterprise is all about.\u2019 Hence 42 is followed by sentence 1. The contrast in sentence 3 beginning with \u2018still\u2019 comes suitably after sentence 1. 4-2 and 1-3 being mandatory pairs, 1342 is another plausible sequence. (The emphasis changes from the theme of 'limited scientific knowledge of the universe to the 'fun activity of gaining knowledge') However, \u201cto learn all at once of the discoveries of an alien civilization...\u2019 in sentence 3 makes better sense when the idea of \u201cour (limited) current knowledge of the universe\u2026\u201d is already introduced.\u00a0 Hence, 4213\u00a0</p>",

With climate change, coffee is going to be one of those genera that are going to be highly impacted because of its limited suitability for wider eco-regions. <br>2. Coffee species are notoriously difficult to conserve for a variety of reasons.<br>3. We definitely need to develop cryopreservation capabilities if we're interested in preserving the wild relatives of many of our tropical crop species.<br>4.

    "Explanation": "Sentence 2 explicitly states the theme, and gives us the clue for what to look for further \u2013 the variety of reasons explaining why conservation of coffee is notoriously difficult.  Sentence 1 gives one reason. Sentence 4 gives another reason. If we try to relate the remaining sentences 3 and 5 to the theme, we find that \u2018each species\u2019 in sentence 5 refers to each species of coffee, and states another reason why conservation of coffee is difficult. Sentence 3 is too general, and talks about the need for cryopreservation capabilities which is not directly related to the theme of the other four sentences. Hence, 3.",

Find the value of \u2018M\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enter your response (as an integer) using the virtual keyboard in the box provided.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>[quizky-text]</em></p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Let the capacity of the three pipes be x, 2x and 4x litres per hour.</p>\n<p>As the largest pipe fills the empty tank in 7 hours, capacity of the tank = 7 \u00d7 4x = 28x</p>\n<p>The smallest pipe took 28 hours to fill the tank. Therefore, it has filled the empty tank.</p>\n<p>i.e., the three pipes must have emptied the tank.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imsclick2cert.blob.core.windows.net/imsitemimages/636886750554428772_7545804.PNG\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Therefore, the required answer is 4.</p>",
