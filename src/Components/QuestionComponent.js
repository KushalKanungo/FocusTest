      <div>There is a lawn with green area equal to 5000 m2. The green area of the lawn decreases as the square of the number of cows grazing in the lawn. Two cows together ate 8 m2 area of the lawn on the first day and everyday two new cows join them. The growth of grass of the lawn on a particular day is directly proportional to the cube of the number of days. If 4 m2 area of grass grew on the first day, on which of the following days would the green area of lawn be 5000 m2 again the first time after the 1st day?</div>

    </div>
